# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
First, assign the given values a variable name.
### Step 2: 
Let the variable names be x1, y1, x2, y2.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Then, print the obtained distance using format.
### Step 5: 
End of the program.
### PROGRAM:
  ```

x1 = 4
x2 = 10
y1 = 2
y2 = 6
distance = ((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)**(1/2)
print("{:0.2f}".format(distance))
  ```
